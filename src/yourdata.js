  aboutParaOne:
    "Hmm, where do I start ? I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a certificate in Game Development. I currently based out of AZ and am looking for full-time opportunities or internships.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "I love developing new hobbies and learning something new with every chance that I get. A current list of things that have saved me from boredom this summer include basketball, cooking, working out and messing around with a ukulele. I ocassionally sing and am looking forward to practicing more once I get the time. Sarcasm and subtle humor is my forte. Music is one of the most poetic forms of expression and anything related to it makes me excited. I have 3 playlists on Spotify that average around 27 hours per list. Do check them out :)",
  aboutParaThree:
    "Technology has played a huge part in my early childhood. Coming from the era of Windows 98 and floppy disks, I was able to live through a huge chunk of the ever-evolving tech industry. I am also an avid gamer, with story-centered and arena style shooters being my favourite. Mortal Kombat 11 and God of War have been my recent favourites. My love for video games, movies and music were instrumental in my interest towards design, eventually leading up to me working on front-end projects. My love for science and space have led to me trying out logical/back-end development. A culmination of all these interests and passions motivated me to start learning to develop on a full-stack level. I like stepping into different paradigms in the tech world and am always open to talk about tech, stories and products.",
